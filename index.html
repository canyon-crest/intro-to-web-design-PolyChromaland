<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="#img1-full"><img class="reveal" src="images/MeAndFriends.PNG" id="pic1" alt="Me and friends"></a>
  My name is Tan Copeland. I am seventeen years old and I live in San Diego, California with my mother and father. I attend the high school <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a> as a junior and I am a member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cca-envision/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Envision Visual Arts Conservatory</a> program. I have a lot of friends and have many connections with different people, as I find meeting and getting to know new people very fun and exciting. Although I have my own issues and worries about life, I would say that I am very content with how my life is going and overall, I am happy.  <span class="highlight">I greatly believe that I have a big future ahead of me.</span></p>

<h3>What are my interests?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="#img2-full"><img class="reveal" src="images/IndigoCity.PNG" id="pic2" alt="Indigo City"></a>
  My greatest passions lie in art, music, and writing. I adore creating visual art and expressing my creativity through creating characters and fantasy worlds, telling stories through the lens of art. I have been playing piano ever since I was very little, and today, composing music still stands as one of my greatest interests. I now both play piano often and compose music digitally using a program called <a href="https://www.image-line.com/en" target="_blank">FL Studio</a>. Writing tales and fables about fictional happenings is greatly fulfilling to me, as <span class="highlight">it makes me feel like our world does not have to be as dull as many see it, you just have to read between the lines.</span> All three of these passions tie together into being able to tell stories through art, music, and writing, and I hope that one day I can inspire others to explore creativity. There is a storytelling-based passion project of mine that I have been working on for a long time now that one day wish to complete. </p>

<h3>What will I achieve?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="#img3-full"><img src="images/Lighting.png" id="pic3" alt="Lighting"></a>
  One day, I hope to have something that I can show to the world. Not something little to present to a small audience, but something that I will have put blood, sweat, tears, and love into that can inspire the world to take action. A good way to gain traction in achieving this goal is to post on social media, hence why I run a lot of my artistic projects through my <a href="https://m.youtube.com/@polychroma0" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a> and my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/poly.chromaland" target="_blank">Instagram page</a>. <span class="highlight">I am a firm believer that if one puts enough love and effort into achieving something, it can and will be achieved. </span> I wish to create things that have so much passion within them that they will influence others to explore themselves and what they want to do in life. I see too many people every day that seem to have no passion for anything and simply go along through their life, but I believe that everyone has passion and interest for something if you dig deep enough.</p>
